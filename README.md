# Qt pybind11 Adapter

A Qt adapter for [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## iborcocpputils

This library uses [iborcocpputils](git@github.com:borco/iborcocpputils.git).

To use it, add *iborcocpputils* as a submodule to your top project and add the location as a subdirectory. *iborcocpputils* is not added a submodule to this project because it is common to other utility libs that I use.
